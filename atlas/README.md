# glyphstudio: how it works

Mapped at 2026-09-30 from commit fdf655b by Atlas 1.24.0.

## What this is

15 parts, mostly TypeScript (424 files), Rust (46), JavaScript (20), CSS (4), Astro (1) and HTML (1). Work enters through 4 doors; the busiest is CI, which reaches 4 parts. It deploys a site to GitHub Pages. glyphstudio is a desktop app built from apps/desktop/src-tauri (nothing ships it).

## What changed since 2026-09-24 (cfb8917)

- CI's pull request trigger now also names `codecov.yml`.
- CI's push trigger now also names `codecov.yml`.
- glyphstudio (apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml) is a new desktop app. It runs apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs.
- apps/desktop/src-tauri/gen/schemas/ is now written by apps/desktop/src-tauri/build.rs.
- docs/dogfood/stage44-quality/*-post-*x*.png is now written by scripts/dogfood-44-quality.mjs.
- docs/dogfood/stage44-quality/*-pre-*x*.png is now written by scripts/dogfood-44-quality.mjs.
- And 3 more new writers and readers of places.
- desktop was authored and is now mixed.
- 1 file added and 653 changed content, across 14 parts.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request to main touching 9 paths; on a push to main touching 9 paths; or by hand. Runs packages/domain/src/ciGates.test.ts, packages/domain/src/shortcutManifest.test.ts, packages/domain/src/sizeProfile.test.ts and 118 more; checks packages/domain/src/, packages/mcp-sprite-server/src/ and packages/state/src/.
2. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
3. **Dogfood.** By hand. Runs no file this map can see.
4. **glyphstudio** (a desktop app built from apps/desktop/src-tauri, which nothing ships). Runs apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs 5 files in domain, 23 files in mcp-sprite-server, and 93 files in state; it checks packages/domain/src/ in domain, packages/mcp-sprite-server/src/ in mcp-sprite-server and packages/state/src/ in state.
2. That reaches api-contract (4 files).
3. It writes to docs/benchmark-assets/, examples/benchmark-assets/ and packages/mcp-sprite-server/fixtures/golden/.
4. It uploads coverage to Codecov.

## Who reads the results

- **docs/benchmark-assets/** has no reader in this repository.
- **examples/benchmark-assets/** has no reader in this repository.
- **packages/mcp-sprite-server/fixtures/golden/** is read by packages/mcp-sprite-server/examples/run-workflows.ts, and by 1 test.

## The other doors

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, and deploys the site.

**Dogfood** runs no file this map can see and sends a dispatch to dogfood-lab/testing-os.

**glyphstudio** (a desktop app built from apps/desktop/src-tauri, which nothing ships) runs apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs.

## What breaks what

- **domain** is imported by 4 parts (api-contract, desktop, mcp-sprite-server, state) and sits on the path of 1 door.
- **api-contract** is imported by 2 parts (desktop, state) and sits on the path of 1 door.
- **state** is imported by 2 parts (desktop, mcp-sprite-server) and sits on the path of 1 door.
- **packages/mcp-sprite-server/fixtures/golden/** is written by mcp-sprite-server and read by mcp-sprite-server, and by 1 test; a hand edit reaches every reader.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since the window holds fewer than 30 qualifying commits.

## What no test touches

- **scripts** is imported by no test.
- **showcase** is imported by no test.

64 test files run in no workflow: apps/desktop/src/components/AISettingsPanel.test.tsx, apps/desktop/src/components/AnchorPanel.test.tsx, apps/desktop/src/components/AssetBrowserPanel.test.tsx and 61 more.

## Written but never read

- **apps/desktop/src-tauri/gen/schemas/** is written by apps/desktop/src-tauri/build.rs (a build script) and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/benchmark-assets/** is written by packages/mcp-sprite-server/src/dogfood/materialize.test.ts (a test) and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/dogfood/character-sprite/** is written by scripts/translate-character.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/dogfood/prop-sprite/** is written by scripts/translate-prop.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/dogfood/stage43-creature/** is written by scripts/dogfood-43-creature.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/dogfood/stage43-humanoid/** is written by scripts/dogfood-43-humanoid.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/dogfood/stage43-prop/** is written by scripts/dogfood-43-prop.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.
- **docs/dogfood/stage44-curves/** is written by scripts/dogfood-44-curves.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.

And 17 more places.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, assets/, audit/, dogfood/, the repository root and site/; 59 writes with paths built at run time may land here.

## Where to start

apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs → apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs

Read those in order to follow one run of glyphstudio end to end. This path follows glyphstudio (a desktop app built from apps/desktop/src-tauri, which nothing ships) from its entry, since CI runs only tests and checks.

## What this map cannot see

- 17 imports could not be resolved: `scripts/critique-sprite.mjs` imports a path built at run time; `scripts/critique-sprite.mjs` loads `fast-png` when it is installed, which is not declared; `scripts/dogfood-43-creature.mjs` imports a path built at run time; and 14 more.
- 59 writes and 10 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 13 writes and 31 reads go to a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 30 qualifying commits in the window, and fewer than 25 source files reach 10 revisions.
